# 3D Rotations

We are living in a three-dimensional (3D) world. Therefore, controlling in robotic field requires us to take into account orientations and rotations for our robots. It is important since it is the foundation of positioning and navigating a robot. 

This page will discuss some 3D Rotation Representations methods. At the end of this page, you will know which type of Rotation Representations you should use for your robots.
